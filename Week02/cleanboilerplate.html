      Here is an HTML form containing basic input types. For more information
      and more input types visit W3 Schools
    </p>
    <!-- The form tag itself has no visuals,
        but all input elements wrapped by the form will be grouped
        and submitted together but name. We also get browser default behaviours we want/need -->

    <!-- form actions point to the file or function or 
        Restful API endpoint to process the form data -->

    <!--The method attribute is where you assign which 
        HTTPS method you want to use to submit your form DATA

        GET = Usually to retrieve data (read) from the endpoint - form data is in your URL

        POST = Usually to write data to a new DB entry, form data is in the request body

        DELETE = To delete a record - usually need some sort of unique identifier 
        passed to the API endpoint or DB to know which one to edit or delete-->

    <form action="'login.js" method="GET" target="_self" name="userSignup">
      <!-- This is an old school HTML only way of creating form/input groups -->
      <fieldset>
        <!-- Label for the form group/fieldset is the legend -->
        <legend>Sample Text input</legend>
        <!--  -->
        <p>The box and title are created by the fieldset and legend tags</p>
        <!-- For accessibility, name for DB, ID for local JS scripts -->

        <label for="lastName ">Last name:</label>
